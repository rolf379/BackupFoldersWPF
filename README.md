# BackupFoldersWPF
A Simple Windows Presentation Foundation App to backup directories, using C#. 
A one button click backup, drop one or multiple directories in the list area. The output file size can be reduced efficiently by using the 'exclude files or directories' function.

The backup can be stored either on hard drives, USB drives, or over the network.  Compression can be done in three different formats.

Extracting file formats depends on its specific installed applications.
